              "\"**Discuss the political developments in the Maldives in the last two years. Should they be of any cause for concern to India?**\\n\\nThe Maldives is a small island nation in the Indian Ocean, located about 700 kilometers southwest of India. The country has a population of about 500,000 people and is a popular tourist destination. In the last two years, the Maldives has seen a number of political developments that have raised concerns in India.\\n\\n**The first major development was the election of President Abdulla Yameen in 2013. Yameen is a former tourism minister and is known for his close ties to the former dictator, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. Yameen's election was seen as a setback for democracy in the Maldives, as he is seen as a more authoritarian leader than his predecessor, Mohamed Nasheed.**\\n\\n**The second major development was the arrest of former President Nasheed in 2015. Nasheed was arrested on charges of terrorism and sentenced to 13 years in prison. The arrest was widely condemned by the international community, and it further raised concerns about the state of democracy in the Maldives.**\\n\\n**The third major development was the Maldives' withdrawal from the Commonwealth of Nations in 2016. The Maldives withdrew from the Commonwealth after the organization criticized the government's human rights record. The withdrawal was seen as a further sign of the Maldives' drift away from democracy.**\\n\\n**These political developments have raised concerns in India for a number of reasons. First, India is concerned about the Maldives' growing ties with China. China has been investing heavily in the Maldives in recent years, and it is seen as a potential threat to India's strategic interests in the region. Second, India is concerned about the Maldives' deteriorating human rights record. The Maldives has been accused of arbitrary arrests, torture, and other human rights abuses. Third, India is concerned about the Maldives' drift away from democracy. India is a democracy, and it is concerned about the implications of the Maldives' democratic backsliding for its own democracy.**\\n\\n**India has expressed its concerns about the Maldives' political developments through a number of channels. India has raised its concerns with the Maldives government, and it has also raised its concerns at the United Nations. India has also provided financial and technical assistance to the Maldives' democratic institutions.**\\n\\n**It is important to note that the Maldives is a sovereign nation, and India cannot dictate its internal affairs. However, India has a legitimate interest in the Maldives' political stability and its democratic development. India's concerns about the Maldives are based on its own strategic interests and its commitment to democracy.**\\n\\n**In conclusion, the political developments in the Maldives in the last two years have raised concerns in India. These concerns are based on India's strategic interests and its commitment to democracy. India has expressed its concerns through a number of channels, and it will continue to monitor the situation in the Maldives.**\""
